This package (ising) is here to do some cool ising model data analysis all or
mostly in c. I have already done this in python, and aim to do some more
low-level c programming and project structure. 

Things will be glued together in Python mostly, but the core engines must be in
C for speed considerations. I probably won't try concurrency in C. But maybe I
will.
